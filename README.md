# PseudoFlow App

Welcome to **PseudoFlow App**, an open-source project inspired by the idea of bridging the gap between code and pseudo code through intelligent transformations. This project is built as a foundation to enable developers to document, understand, and refactor code through pseudo code equivalents.

> **Note:** This repository is in its initial planning stage and does not contain any code yet. Contributions and discussions are highly encouraged to shape the direction of this project.

## Project Inspiration

PseudoFlow App is inspired by the goal of creating a seamless connection between code and human-readable representations. The concept was motivated by the need for a better way to document, review, and refactor complex projects using structured pseudo code.

We found inspiration in other open-source projects and code-to-pseudo code conversion tools. PseudoFlow aims to build upon these ideas by offering more integrated and structured functionalities within popular IDEs like **VSCode** and **IntelliJ**.

## Vision

**PseudoFlow App** intends to provide:

- **Bi-directional conversion** between code and pseudo code.
- A **mirror directory system** (`.pseudo`) to hold pseudo code versions of each project file.
- **Customizable pseudo code standards** based on language and project needs.
- **AI-powered consistency checks** and improvements to maintain structural accuracy.

## Current Status

This project is at an **early conceptual stage**. We are actively working on designing the architecture and gathering feedback to develop a clear roadmap.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community to help design and define the core concepts of **PseudoFlow App**. Join us in brainstorming and shaping the future of code documentation!

- **Discussions:** Share your thoughts and ideas in the [Discussions](https://github.com/AnuverseHQ/PseudoFlowApp/discussions) tab.
- **Roadmap Suggestions:** Help us prioritize and refine our development roadmap by submitting suggestions.
